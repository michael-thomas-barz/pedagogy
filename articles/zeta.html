<h1>What is the Riemann hypothesis?</h1>
<p class="meta">February ?, 2026</p>

<p>
One of the oldest theorems in mathematics is that there are infinitely many primes. Euclid (the geometer!) proved this around 300 BCE, and for centuries afterwards the story ended there. There are infinitely many primes, what else is there to ask?
</p>

<p>
However, some infinite sets are more `common' than others. For example, even numbers are pretty common, but powers of 2 are pretty rare: between \(1\) and \(1000,\) there are 500 even numbers, but only ten powers of 2. 
</p>

<p>
To measure the size of an infinite set of numbers \(A\), it is useful to think about its <em>natural density</em>, defined as
\[d(A) := \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\#(\text{elements of \(A\) from \(1\) to \(N\)})}{N}.\]
