<h1>Hensel's Lemma</h1>
<p class="meta">February 2026</p>

<p>
Calculus is the mathematics of <em>approximations of continuous quantities</em>; number theory asks exact problems about discrete quantities. These seem, therefore, to be unrelated studies.
</p>

<p>
Yet Kurt Hensel made a remarkable discovery: using ideas from calculus, one can better understand number theory problems. We're going to explain Hensel's wonderful discovery, by trying to solve polynomial equations in <em>modular arithmetic</em>. More particularly, we are going to try and find all integers \(x\) such that
\[x^3 - 17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv 0 \pmod{3000}.\]
</p>

<p>
While this sort of problem -- solving a polynomial equation in <em>modular arithmetic</em> -- might seem a bit strange, it actually leads directly to the \emph{Langlands program} in modern number theory, as we'll comment a little about at the end.
</p>

<h2>A first reduction</h2>

<p>
The prime factorization of 3000 is 
\[3000 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5^3.\]
</p>

<p>
The <em>Chinese remainder theorem</em> tells us that solving
\[x^3 -17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv 0 \pmod{3000}\]
is, therefore, equivalent to solving the \emph{three} different congruences
\[x^3 - 17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv 0\pmod{2^3},\]
\[x^3 - 17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv 0\pmod{3},\]
\[x^3 - 17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv 0\pmod{125}.\]
</p>

<p>
It might seem like we've made our problem \emph{harder}, not easier: we used to have one equation, but now we have three! However, there is a sense in which our life has been made simpler: to solve 
\[x^3 - 17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv 0 \pmod{8},\]
for example, we only need to plug in \(x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\) and \(7.\) This is only eight values to try. If we simplify our polynomial to
\[x^3 -17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv x^3 - x^2 + 4x \pmod{8},\]
and plug in each of the possible values, we quickly find that the only solutions to our equation modulo 8 are 
\[x \equiv 0, 4 \pmod{8}.\]
</p>

<p>
Similarly, we can plug in \(x= 0, 1, 2\) to find that the only solution to 
\[x^3 - 17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv 0\pmod{3}\]
is \(x \equiv 1 \pmod{3}.\)
</p>

<p>
Just by plugging in a few values, we managed to solve 2 out of 3 of our equations. Unfortunately, plugging in every value from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 124\) to solve
\[x^3 - 17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv 0\pmod{125},\]
seems like it would take much too long. Are there any quicker ways to proceed?
</p>

<h2>Working modulo 5</h2>

<p>
Recall \(125 = 5^3.\) So, if \(x\) is an integer making
\[x^3 - 17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv 0 \pmod{125},\]
then we also have
\[ x^3 - 17x^2 + 12x + 16 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}.\]
</p>

<p>
This equation is a little easier to solve: we can plug in \(x = 0, 1, 2, 3,\) and 4 to find that the only solutions to the equation above is
\[x \equiv 2 \pmod{5}.\]
</p>

<p>
When we plug in \(x = 2\) to our polynomial, we get
\[2^3 - 17 \cdot 2^2 + 12 \cdot 2 + 16 = -20.\]
</p>

<p>
This number is indeed divisible by 5... but it is not a multiple of \(125.\) However, Hensel thought that \(-20\) is \emph{close} to being zero modulo 125, because \(125 = 5^3,\) and \(-20\) is at least divisible by 5 once, even if it isn't divisible by 5 three times.
</p>

<p>
On its own, this thought would probably not be so helpful. What made this idea so remarkable was what Hensel did \emph{next}. Before we can explain that, though, we need to take a brief digression to recall an insight from calculus.
